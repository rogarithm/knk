e3 C89 flag for GCC: -ansi or -std=c89

Seems nothing to note. Every result is intuitive.

e4

Same result with e3.c. That is, C89 and C99 specification works the same way in this problem.

e5

% character can be escaped with %. Odd result: (c) 8 % -5 is 3, (d) -8 % -5 is -3

e6

Same odd result as e5. 

e7

When using original algorithm, it's computed as 9->9->0, whereas using "improved" one goes 1->9, which is not the same as the original.

e8

No. It'll behave differently if an input is 10, 20, or 30, and so on.
