int a[] = {5, 15, 34, 54, 14, 2, 52, 72};
int *p = &a[1], *q = &a[5]; // now p points 15, q points 2

(a) What is the value of *(p+3)? *(a[4]) = 14
(b) What is the value of *(q-3)? *(a[2]) = 34
(c) What is the value of q-p? 4
(d) Is the condition p < q true or false? true.
(e) Is the condition *p < *q true or false? false.
