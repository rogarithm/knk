e1 ok.

e2 ok.

e3 ok.

e4 ok.

- currently refinement is being done for e4-revision.c. When all revision done, e4-revision -> e4, and rm e4.
- rename functions to deliver its purpose better
- refined tests for wrong test cases. todo: include each conditions

e5 ok.

- edit test statement to see its meaning more easily
- Would it be better to use getchar?

e6 ok.

- For exceptional cases, how about implementing loop to enter a proper value with message?

e7 ok. But not sure?

e8 (a), (b) is valid prototype. Couldn't recall the reason. But I think it doesn't need now. Document when needed.

- refine functions to get array length as input, not length - 1.
- modify average element function's return type to cover float output.

e11

- refine with getchar(), but not sure its validity. When all revision done, e11-rev -> e11, and rm e11.

e14 seems to work, but an error occurs (control may reach end of non-void function). Is this from difference btw return type of functions and printf's bool conv-spec in main function?
