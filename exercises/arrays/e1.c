Unlike ◊code{ sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) }, ◊code{ sizeof(a) / sizeof(t) } choose the type of the elements of the array ◊code{ a }. If the type of elements of the array ◊code{ a } gets changed, though the ◊code{ t } of ◊code{ sizeof(a) / sizeof(t) } should be editted to the changed type of element, the ◊code{ a[0] } need not be changed, because it's ◊val will be converted subject to changed type. Thus, for the maintenance aspect, ◊code{ sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0] } would be superior technique than ◊code{ sizeof(a) / sizeof(t) }.
