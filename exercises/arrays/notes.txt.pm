e1 ok.

e2 Still don't understand what is digit in character form. Is "a digit in 'a' form is 65" is right?

e3 ok. How about making alternative with macro for boolean value?

e4 ok. Boolean value is printed as 0 (false) or 1 (true).

e5 ok.

 - add comments to describe purpose of some lines.
 - separate printing procedure requires a function to consume an array as an input. Refine later.

e6 ok.

e7 ok. But if I want to check if e6 == e7, how to do? With a loop?

e8 Specifying the number of rows and days is sufficient?

e9 ok.

 - Simplify the number of row and column for easy test.
 - Modify type for estimated calculation with input.
 - Refine conversion specifier.

e10 ok.

e11 ok. How to verify my output is true?
