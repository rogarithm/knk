Is there any difference between &* and *& for cases when applied to a pointer and an int value?

? e2

Can an address have its address?
Does the address operator not affect the validity that pointer can be an lvalue?
&* and *& doesn't modify the operand's property?

e3 ok.

e4 ok.

e5 ok.

e6 ok.

 - test for multiple cases?

e7 ok.

 - make cases for test

? e8

 - works. but is it valid to declare a pointer inside a function and use it as a return value for main?
