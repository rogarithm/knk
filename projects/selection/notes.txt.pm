p1 ok

p2

is this refine still verbose?
simplify the function. Minute variable doesn't affect to converting process.
"0x", where x is from 0 to 9, is printed as "x". refine later. -> refine with %.2d
cases to test: 0:00 -> 12:00 AM | 12:00 -> 12:00 PM | 24:00 -> 12:00 AM -> done. other test required?

? p3

need to simplify and test

p4

same as p1.c

p5

solved to solve p2 of functions.
previously it seems to be the same as p1 and p4, with different conditions.

? p6

Is this okay to do this way?

add check-digit as additional input, compare with computed check-digit. If the two values are equal, print VALID. If not, print NOT VALID.

p7

◊start-here{temp.c}

Though I made a logic I think correct, as the author said only four if statements are sufficient, refactoring required.

works fine with the test case in the problem (21 43 10 35). Should I validate with another data set?

My solution doesn't consider when any of two elements have the same value. Update when needed.

N p8

N p9
 
N p10
 
the answer should be written using switch ◊|st|.

N p11

same as p10
