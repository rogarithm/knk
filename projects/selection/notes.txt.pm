p1.c

p2.c

"0x", where x is from 0 to 9, is printed as "x". refine later.
also, else clause gets evaluated every time.
cases to test: 0:00 -> 12:00 AM | 12:00 -> 12:00 PM | 24:00 -> 12:00 AM

p3.c

write original program. The relation is uncertain between value and the number of shares & the price per share.
Also it's uncertain about the meaning of the character in (b). Seems it's not that difficult if I find the meaning of the char.

p4.c

same as p1.c

N p5.c

seems to be the same as p1 and p4, with different conditions.

p6.c

add check-digit as additional input, compare with computed check-digit. If the two ◊|val| are equal, print VALID. If not, print NOT VALID.

p7.c

make a logic I think correct. Because the author said only four if ◊|st| are sufficient, should think about reducing code.

works fine with the test case in the problem (21 43 10 35). Should I validate with another data set?

My solution doesn't consider when any of two elements have the same value. Update when needed.

N p8.c

N p9.c
 
N p10.c
 
the answer should be written using switch ◊|st|.

N p11.c

same as p10.c
