p1 ok.

 - refine to split main info functions for input, output
 - separate a, b into individual files.

p2 ok.

 - could the nested if statement in while be simplified?

? p3 For now it seems hard to take advantage of the fact "an array name can be used to pointer" because there's assginment of array's value:

p3.c:15:*p++ = ch;

? p4 Same as p3. My solution is using assignment for object of pointer.

N p5 Not done p14 of arrays ch yet.

N p6-p7
