p1

what if first argument is 0?
is there a way to get out of the loop without evaluating second if statement? Or is it matter?

p2

refine variables:
 - for two same temp whose purposes are different, give more specific names, swap and mod each. As these don't need to be used outside their statement, made them local.
 - Remove ans because it's redundant. It's the same with m.

◊todo{But is there a chance that n do not reach 0?}

p3

change gcd function with editted p2.c
modify variable names
◊todo{◊uc{would it be better to check whether the numerator and denominator aren't divisable before executing gcd?}}


p4 ok.

p5 ok.

Is it necessary to assign every divided value? No.

Is the printing necessary to use variables for each number? Yes, but it doesn't have to be all at once.

p6 ok. Would it be better to use tenary operator for if

p7 ok. in expr3 of for loop, is the order need to be changed, or increment type of i should be prefixed like the original code?

p8 ok.

N p9 - p12
