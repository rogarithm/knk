p1.c
edit source code to add leading 0 when a ◊var{year} or ◊var{day} is between 1 to 9. check out ◊|conv-spec| for ◊f{printf} and ◊f{scanf}.

p2.c
also needs an answer of p1.c. check out how to insert tab in ◊f{printf}, and readability of last statement.

for now details of ◊f{printf} and ◊f{scanf} seems not that important. solve these (and search for p1.c, p2.c also) when you need it.
