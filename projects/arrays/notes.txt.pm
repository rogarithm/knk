p1 ok.

p2 ok.

p3 ok.

p4 refine by making macro for array length

p5 works, but need to check if it computes as I intended, and requires (simple) test.

Is this right? 1 annually increased value = compound of 12 iterately increased value

p6 ok.

 - but in printing part, why it prints garbage values when EOF condition is included?
 - type of the array when it has chars, whitespace, comma as element -> always char.
 - how to scan the array -> with getchar(), the elements of array can be scanned one by one.
 - method to convert to uppercase & number for proper chars -> because the array is type of char, the number we want to convert will be the type of char, which means we need to specify them with â—Šuc{character form of int}.

? p7 how can simplify? Currently I need to define for all 5 cases.

 currently on temp-p7. what's the problem? keep make it more simple to test!

N p8

? p9

- make a directory for test
- the design right now cannot give the new col (or row) value into the main function. Is there a way to give? or should I need to implement other design?

p10 ok, but skeletal. refine later for formatting and organizing.

p11 ok, but skeletal as p10.

p12 ok. needs refine?

N from p13 to p17
