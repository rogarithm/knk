naming convention

just like file names in scribblings/, dir name with chapter name seems
good for repetitive searching. So I've converted so far.

directory organize

d. scribblings
<collect-array.txt.pm>

Related to my array problem in collect-array.txt.pm. The information
should be kept collected from the documents I've been writing tagged
by â—Šcollect-array. This tag should be implemented to select sentences
that can be viewed on one document, as the file I've made is just for
temporary usage. It doesn't notify me exactly where the sentence from,
and no updates also.

d. cprog2
download source files of knk C programs. use for reference.

<notes.txt.pm>
questions for unsolved problems are in notes.txt.

for problems that require just plain texted answer, I write it in
notes.txt.pm where I put every problems I've done and the reason why
for problems I've not done yet.

for notes.txt.pm: for now, I use * to *ed problems, N to not solved
ones. There could be several reasons why I stop solving, or why I didn't
start, what to do more about a problem. Select short names for each
could be better.

Also at the top, writing down every problem numbers with its status
short name could make future me easily check where I am.

If it's too repetitive to make notes.txt.pm in every chapter dir. Make
only one notes.txt.pm (maybe for each top dirs) and folding each
chapter's notes be a better idea to maintain and check.

<styles.css.pp>

add styles.css. error from arity mismatch. requires edit.

edit functions that have zero or more arguments with condition
statement.

requires font style, properties for box model for now.

style

don't need to cover every sections and elements. rather, choose what to
document, think how to illustrate the contents well. don't just write
down the same as the original book.
